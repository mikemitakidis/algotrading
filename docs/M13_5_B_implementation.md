# M13.5.B — eToro Live Writer Implementation

**Status:** implemented, tested offline. NO real-money POST performed.
**Predecessor:** M13.5.A evidence pack (commit `2b90a37`).
**Scope:** ship the operator-only eToro live-write capability behind a
double live flag + per-payload nonce, with strict scanner isolation.

---

## 1. What this milestone delivers

A real-money eToro order can now be placed, but **only** by an operator
running `tools/etoro_live_write.py` from a shell, and **only** when every
one of the following is simultaneously true:

1. `routing.etoro_live_enabled = true` in the Broker Allocation policy
   (set via the dashboard Risk page, persisted in `portfolio_risk_state`).
2. `ETORO_LIVE_ENABLED=true` in `.env`.
3. The 16-gate preflight passes (policy validity, global/broker
   switches, kill switches, capital/position/loss caps, market state,
   quote freshness, spread).
4. The operator echoes the correct per-payload nonce
   (`CONFIRM <8-hex-digest>`) at run time.

If any one is missing, no POST is emitted. The scanner, strategy, risk
manager, dashboard, and `get_broker()` cannot reach the live writer at
all — it is constructed solely by the operator CLI.

## 2. New modules (`bot/etoro/`)

| Module | Responsibility | Network? |
|---|---|---|
| `nonce.py` | Per-payload, single-use, TTL-bound confirmation nonce | no |
| `audit.py` | Redaction primitives + rotating JSONL audit log | no |
| `response_parser.py` | Parse eToro open/order-info responses per OpenAPI | no |
| `lifecycle.py` | Sole writer of eToro intent rows; sets `submitted_at` | DB only |
| `order_poller.py` | Bounded 5×2s post-POST polling; fails closed to `unverified` | via injected reader |
| `signal_only_broker.py` | Wrapper that records intents without submitting; preserves Telegram | no |
| `live_broker.py` | `EtoroLiveBroker`: preflight + single POST. **Operator-only.** | yes (operator only) |

## 3. New tools (`tools/`)

| Tool | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `etoro_live_write.py` | The **only** constructor of `EtoroLiveBroker`. `oneshot` subcommand: preflight → nonce confirm → single POST → bounded poll. |
| `etoro_reconcile.py` | Controlled reconciliation after an `unverified` outcome. Updates lifecycle via `bot.etoro.lifecycle` only — never raw SQL, never an eToro write. Has an import-time guard against being loaded alongside `live_broker`. |

## 4. Modified production files

- `bot/broker_allocation.py`
  - `ALLOWED_BROKER_WHITELIST` now includes `etoro_real`; `FORBIDDEN_BROKERS`
    is now empty. Live writes are gated at **runtime**, not at policy
    validation.
  - The M13.4A `etoro_live_forbidden` rejection is removed.
  - `is_auto_trading_allowed()` now uses strict `routing.etoro_live_enabled
    is True` (identity), not `bool(...)` — **ChatGPT audit fix**.
- `bot/brokers/__init__.py`
  - `BROKER=etoro_real` **still raises `ValueError`** — the registry never
    constructs the live writer (scanner-isolation invariant).
  - New behaviour: when policy disables auto-trading for the active
    broker, `get_broker()` returns `SignalOnlyBroker(concrete, reason)`.
    `main.py` is untouched; the Telegram alert path that runs after
    `broker.submit()` is unaffected because the wrapper still returns a
    normal `OrderResult`.

## 5. ChatGPT audit fixes (all applied)

1. **Strict identity** on `routing.etoro_live_enabled is True` in
   `is_auto_trading_allowed`, `determine_signal_only_reason`, and
   `EtoroLiveBroker.preflight`. A truthy-but-not-`True` value never
   enables a live write.
2. **Validate policy first** — `preflight()` calls `validate_policy()`
   before reading any policy field; invalid policy → `PolicyInvalid`,
   no POST.
3. **`submitted_at` correctness** — `lifecycle.apply_transition(...,
   "submitted")` sets `submitted_at`. `flywheel.update_intent_status`
   only set it for `accepted`/`paper_logged`, which would have left the
   eToro `submitted` rows with a NULL timestamp.
4. **No hidden schema migration** — `client_intent_id`, `nonce_digest`,
   and `x_request_id` are stored inside the existing `lifecycle_json`
   column. No `ALTER TABLE`, no new columns.

## 6. Safety properties (enforced + tested)

- **Single POST, no retry.** `submit_live()` issues exactly one POST and
  never retries on 429/5xx/network error. The poller has no POST
  capability — it only takes a read callable.
- **Fail closed.** Unknown daily loss → `DailyLossUnknown`. Stale/absent
  quote → `StaleQuote`. Exhausted polling → `unverified`, never a second
  POST.
- **No secrets in logs.** `x-api-key`/`x-user-key`/`Authorization` are
  redacted in every audit record; account IDs truncated to last 4 chars;
  Bearer tokens scrubbed. The audit logger never raises on I/O failure.
- **Scanner isolation.** `test_m13_5_scanner_isolation.py` proves that
  importing `bot.scanner`/`bot.strategy`/`bot.risk`/`bot.brokers` does
  not transitively import `bot.etoro.live_broker`, that
  `BROKER=etoro_real` raises `ValueError`, and that
  `EtoroLiveBroker.submit()` raises `OperatorConfirmationRequired`.

## 7. Lifecycle status vocabulary

`pending_live_write → awaiting_confirm → submitted → {filled |
broker_rejected | cancelled | unverified}`; plus `policy_rejected` /
`risk_rejected` (preflight) and `closed_manual` (operator close). eToro
`statusID` mapping: 0/4 → submitted (keep polling), 1 → filled (only
once `positions[]` is populated), 2 → cancelled, 3 → broker_rejected;
`errorCode` set → broker_rejected regardless of statusID.

`filled → closed_manual` is an explicitly-permitted lifecycle transition
(the operator manual-close path) and does **not** require
`allow_terminal_override`; every other transition out of a terminal
status still does. The operator CLI loads `<repo>/.env` automatically at
startup (no manual `source` needed); an already-exported variable is not
overridden, and no secret value is ever printed.

Real-money mode always uses exactly `https://public-api.etoro.com`. The
CLI exposes **no** `--base-url` override, so real credentials can never
be redirected to an arbitrary host by a mistyped or copied command. The
base URL is returned by `_read_keys` (fixed real API for real mode; a
verified sandbox URL for demo, which is disabled). Tests exercise
alternate endpoints only via an injected transport at the broker level,
never via a CLI flag.

## 8. Test summary

New M13.5.B suites (154 tests; run in two processes to honour the
reconcile import-time guard):

- `test_m13_5_nonce.py`, `test_m13_5_audit.py`, `test_m13_5_parser.py`,
  `test_m13_5_lifecycle.py`, `test_m13_5_poller.py`,
  `test_m13_5_live_broker.py`, `test_m13_5_signal_only.py`,
  `test_m13_5_scanner_isolation.py` — 144 with `live_broker` loaded.
- `test_m13_5_reconcile.py` — 10, run in its own process.

Regression (all green): M12 13/13 (offline), M14 39/39, M13.2 42/42,
M13.3 48/48, M13.4A 61/61, M15 schema 6/6, M15 gateway 33/33,
M15.2 health 28/28.

M13.2/M13.3 read-path no-write AST scans were scoped to exclude the
sanctioned operator-only `live_broker.py` (`EXCLUDED_FILES`), and the
`etoro_real` ValueError-message assertions were updated to match the new
"operator-only" wording. All other `bot/etoro/` modules remain
write-free and env-read-free.

## 9. Open known unknowns (deferred)

Carried from M13.5.A §8 — to be resolved before the first real write,
not in this milestone:

- §8.1 No-SL/No-TP encoding (currently `IsNoStopLoss`/`IsNoTakeProfit`).
- §8.2 Failure response body shape (parser is defensive across shapes).
- §8.3 statusID semantics across order types.
- §8.6 API-side minimum `Amount` (CLI default `--amount-min=10.0`).
- §8.7 Cancel-endpoint exact path (not invoked in the happy path).

**Demo mode is DISABLED in M13.5.B.** `--demo` fails closed with a clear
error (`DEMO_MODE_ENABLED = False`) before any credential read, runtime
import, or broker construction. The earlier draft allowed demo mode to
fall back to real credentials and to use the real public API base URL
while bypassing `ETORO_LIVE_ENABLED` — that was unsafe and has been
removed. Re-enabling demo requires ALL of `ETORO_DEMO_API_KEY`,
`ETORO_DEMO_USER_KEY`, and a verified `ETORO_DEMO_BASE_URL` (sandbox),
with no fallback to real keys and no use of the real API base for demo.
Until a verified sandbox URL exists, the §8 unknowns are resolved by
other means (documentation/operator inspection), not by a live demo
call.

No demo call and no real call were made in M13.5.B implementation; all
transport in tests is injected.
